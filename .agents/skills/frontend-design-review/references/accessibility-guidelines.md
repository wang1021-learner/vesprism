## WCAG 2.1 Principles

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 are organized around four principles, often abbreviated as **POUR**:

## 1. **Perceivable**

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### 2. **Operable**

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### 3. **Understandable**

Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

### 4. **Robust**

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Conformance Levels

- **Level A**: Minimum level of conformance
- **Level AA**: Recommended level (addresses most common barriers)
- **Level AAA**: Highest level (not required for all content)

**Target for Most Projects**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

---

## Perceivable Guidelines

### 1.1 Text Alternatives (Level A)

**Guideline**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content.

#### 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

**Requirements:**

- All images must have appropriate alt text
- Decorative images must have empty alt attribute (`alt=""`)
- Functional images (buttons, links) must describe function
- Complex images (charts, diagrams) need detailed descriptions

**Review Checklist:**

- [ ] All informative images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Alt text concise and meaningful (not "image of...")
- [ ] Decorative images marked with `alt=""`
- [ ] Icons paired with accessible labels
- [ ] Charts/graphs have text alternatives or data tables
- [ ] Logo alt text includes company name
- [ ] Image buttons describe action, not appearance

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**

```html
<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Sarah Johnson, CEO">
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from Q1 to Q2">
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="">
<button><img src="search-icon.svg" alt="Search"></button>
```

❌ **Bad:**

```html
<img src="profile.jpg" alt="image">
<img src="chart.png" alt="chart">
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="decorative line">
<button><img src="search-icon.svg" alt="magnifying glass icon"></button>
```

**Common Patterns:**

| Image Type | Alt Text Approach |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Informative | Describe the information conveyed |
| Functional | Describe the action/function |
| Decorative | Use `alt=""` |
| Complex (charts) | Provide data table or long description |
| Text in images | Include the text verbatim |
| Logo | Company/product name |

## Common Accessibility Issues

### 1. Missing Alt Text

**Impact**: Screen reader users can't understand images  
**Fix**: Add descriptive alt text to all images

### 2. Low Color Contrast

**Impact**: Users with low vision can't read text  
**Fix**: Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for text, 3:1 for UI components

### 3. No Keyboard Access

**Impact**: Keyboard users can't interact with custom controls  
**Fix**: Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible

### 4. Missing Focus Indicators

**Impact**: Keyboard users can't see where focus is  
**Fix**: Ensure visible focus indicators on all interactive elements

### 5. No Form Labels

**Impact**: Screen reader users don't know field purpose  
**Fix**: Use `<label>` element for all form inputs

### 6. Poor Heading Structure

**Impact**: Screen reader users can't navigate by headings  
**Fix**: Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

### 7. Non-descriptive Link Text

**Impact**: Screen reader users hear "click here" without context  
**Fix**: Use descriptive link text that explains destination

### 8. Auto-playing Media

**Impact**: Distracts users, especially those with cognitive disabilities  
**Fix**: Don't auto-play, or provide pause control

### 9. Tiny Touch Targets

**Impact**: Mobile users, especially those with motor disabilities, can't tap accurately  
**Fix**: Ensure 44x44px minimum touch target size

### 10. Inaccessible Modals

**Impact**: Keyboard users trapped, screen reader users confused  
**Fix**: Trap focus within modal, provide Escape key to close

- **Windows**: NVDA (free) or JAWS
- **Mobile**: iOS VoiceOver, Android TalkBack

**Screen Reader Test Checklist:**

- [ ] All content announced
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Headings navigable
- [ ] Landmarks present
- [ ] Form labels associated
- [ ] Buttons/links clearly identified

- Chrome DevTools color picker
- Figma plugins (Stark, A11y - Color Contrast Checker)

**Process:**

1. Check all text against background
2. Check all UI components against adjacent colors
3. Check focus indicators
4. Test in dark mode (if applicable)

### Zoom Testing

**Process:**

1. Zoom browser to 200%
2. Verify no horizontal scrolling
3. Verify content remains readable
4. Verify interactive elements remain accessible

### Mobile Accessibility Testing

**Process:**

1. Test on real devices (iOS, Android)
2. Enable screen reader (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
3. Verify touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
4. Test landscape and portrait orientations
5. Test with assistive touch enabled
